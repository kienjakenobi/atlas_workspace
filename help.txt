OPI Runtime vs. OPI Editor
Just like MEDM, CSS BOY has an execute mode and an edit mode.
To switch between them, right click on an OPI in the left-hand Navigator
pane and choose Open With --> OPI Edtior or OPI Runtime.

First time use
You will need to set the "TS" macro so that it can properlly find your EPICS
server.  Open front.opi in Editor mode and click anywhere on the background.
This should select the widget "root Group."  At the top of the Properties
pane on the right, click on the Value of the Macros entry.  In the box
that appears, set the correct value of the TS variable.

Change the axes on a strip chart
Sometimes you will want to change the axes labeling or the upper and lower
bounds on the axes while you are running the display.  To do this, click the
hammer and spanner icon at the top left of the strip chart.  Click the axes
tab, select the axis you want, and edit its options.  

Take screenshots or graph shots
On Linux, you can probably take a full screenshot just be pressing the
Print Screen keyboard key.  
Either way, you can save an image of any given strip chart in CSS BOY
by pressing the camera icon at the top right of any strip chart.  

Known Issues
- 9 August 2012: When a given trace on the front.opi screen is hidden, 
the graph does not correctly ignore it when autoscaling.  This will be
fixed in the next version of CSS BOY (> 3.1.1).  
- 9 August 2012: CSS BOY screens can not be started from the commandline.
This is a limitation caused by the Eclipse framework, but there are
plausible workarounds.  Developers are working on this.
