Welcome to cssboydeployment's documentation!
============================================

Purpose
---------

APS beam lines will deploy this software expecting to 
use standard screens from the APS, as well as 
locally-produced screens.  Each beam line will need to 
install identical customizations at several beam line 
workstations.   The APS will need occasionally to update 
the suite of standard screens.
