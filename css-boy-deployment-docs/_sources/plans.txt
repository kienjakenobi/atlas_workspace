Plans
==========================

.. note:: This should be changed to reflect new
   pattern discussed at 2012 EPICS Meeting

* use new OPI search path
* synApps screens imported as *synApps* project
	* import from ``/APSshare/epics/synApps_5_6`` or equal
	* import from SVN checkout (working directory)
	* import from tarball extraction

* APS facility screens imported as *APS_sr* project
	* no screens have been converted
		* target just the ``/APSshare/adlsys/sr/fe`` for conversion?
		* install to ``/APSshare/APS_sr`` (outside adlsys since it is receiver of rsync task)
		* create an SVN repo to hold these converts?

	* same priority of imports as synApps

* beam line-specific screens as one or more projects
	* local file system, outside of any one CSS-BOY workspace
	* urge that it go into an SVN repo
	* import into client workspaces

* documentation!
